Similar to ceaser, where we encrypt a sentence or string. This time the every alphabeth have their specific key,
for example the key is 'YTNSHKVEFXRBAUQZCLWDMIPGJO', so the letter 'a' will become 'y', letter 'b' will become 't' and so on
so in this case, the text 'hello, world' will print out 'jrssb, ybwsp'. 
Incase of lower case or upper case, this program will follow the input so if the letter is 'hello' but the key is all capital
the program will still prinout 'jrssb' and not 'JRSSB'
