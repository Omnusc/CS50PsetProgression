Algorithm to gauge the difficulty of a text according to scholastic 
https://www.scholastic.com/teachers/teaching-tools/collections/guided-reading-book-lists-for-every-level.html
with the formula of index = 0.0588 * L - 0.296 * S - 15.8
where L is the average number of letters per 100 words in the text, and S is the average number of sentences per 100 words in the text.
So the algorithm will count how many letter, sentences, and word and use the formula above to determine the level of text
If the resulting index number is 16 or higher (equivalent to or greater than a senior undergraduate reading level), 
program should output "Grade 16+" instead of outputting an exact index number. If the index number is less than 1,  program should output "Before Grade 1".
