Ceaser Algorithm pset 2 cs50
https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/2/caesar/

Algorithm to cipher a string with a specific int key
e.g a string of 'abcd' with key of 1 , the output will be: bcde
1 step after the original string
so if the key is 3 for example, abcd will become 'cdefg'.


The algorithm will not change upper or lowercase letter, and in the case of 
out of bound (1 step after letter 'z') the alphabeth will loop through itself so 1 step after 'z' is 'a'
